# MakeItBurn
A simple load tester to burn your CPU/RAM down

TO COMPILE
This software has been developed in c++ std11 and pthread library, so:

g++ -Wall -pthread -std=c++11 -o makeitburn makeitburn.cpp

It has been developed and tested in Arch Linux, so i cant assure it works over other platforms.
