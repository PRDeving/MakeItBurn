# MakeItBurn
A simple load tester to burn your CPU/RAM down

TO COMPILE
This software has been developed in c++ std11 and pthread library, so you have 2 options:

1- Use the Makefile
    type "make" in the proyects folder and enjoy

2- Compile it youself
    g++ -Wall -pthread -std=c++11 -o makeitburn makeitburn.cpp

THE BINARY INCLUDED IS ONLY FOR ME TO TEST, IT PROBABLY WONT WORK IN OTHER MACHINES, YOU HAVE TO RECOMPILE IT.

It has been developed and tested in Arch Linux x64, i tried to make it as portable as it could be but cant assure it works in other platforms.

Any questions, text me to pablo.deving@gmail.com
